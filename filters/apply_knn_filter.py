def apply_knn_filter(points, knn_config, field_mapping):
    """
    Filters points based on the distances to their k nearest neighbors.
    
    For each point, the k-nearest neighbors are found using a KDTree.
    Then, the average distance (excluding the point itself) is computed.
    A point passes the filter if its average neighbor distance is less than or equal to
    the specified knn_distance_threshold.
    
    Args:
        points (np.ndarray): Structured array of point cloud data.
        knn_config (dict): Configuration for the KNN filter, expected to include:
            - "knn_neighbors": (int) number of neighbors to consider.
            - "knn_distance_threshold": (float) maximum allowable average distance.
        field_mapping (dict): Mapping of field names; expected to include "x", "y", and "z".
        
    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Boolean mask (of the same length as points) indicating which points pass.
